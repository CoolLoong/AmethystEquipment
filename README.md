Amethyst armor, tools, and an amethyst spear (using the 1.17 Amethyst Shards that Minecraft added to the game) without
using the player.json file! I am sure this addon would be the perfect addition to all of your survival and adventure
worlds!

Make sure to turn on `enable-experiment-mode=on` in `server.properties`.

### Usage:

1. Download the ResourcePack from https://mcpedl.com/1-17-amethyst-equipment-armor-tools/ ,Only need to download the
   ResourcePack no BehaviorPack.
2. Download the plugin from the release, and distribute the plugin and resource pack into the `plugins`
   and `resource_packs` folders.
3. Turn on `enable-experiment-mode=on` in `server.properties`.
